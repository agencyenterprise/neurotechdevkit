    Implementation notes:
        - Alternatively, delay-and-sum can be implemented using an explicit
            for-loop over the delays. However, Python for-loops are much
            slower than  optimized sparse matrix multiplication.
        - Memory usage for the delay-and-sum matrix is:
            O(num_pixels * num_channels * num_interpolation_points).
        - We use the `xarray` library to simplify broadcasting and indexing.
