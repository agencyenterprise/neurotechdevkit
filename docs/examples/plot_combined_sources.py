Combine sources
====================================

Combining multiple sources for transcranial ultrasound stimulation enables
greater precision and control in targeting specific areas of the brain.

By choosing the phase of ultrasound waves for each source, a combined beam
can be created that is focused on the desired target precisely. This allows
for complex wave patterns that open up new possibilities for therapies.
