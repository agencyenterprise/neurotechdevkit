Phased array source
====================================

Phased arrays consist of multiple individual transducer elements arranged in a
specific pattern, such as a linear or circle. Each element can be controlled
independently, allowing for precise manipulation of the generated ultrasound
waves. By adjusting the timing or phase of the signals sent to these elements,
the ultrasound waves can be focused, steered, and shaped without mechanically
moving the transducer.

They are becoming increasingly popular in the field of transcranial ultrasound
stimulation as they offer several advantages over traditional ultrasound
transducers -- among others are precise targeting and better control over steering
and shaping:

* **Precise targeting:** as individual transducer elements can be individually
controlled, it allows for the generation of a focused ultrasound beam with high
spatial accuracy. This enables the stimulation of specific brain regions without
affecting the surrounding healthy tissue and minimizes the risk of potential side
effects.

* **Steering and shaping:** The phased array technology allows the ultrasound beam
to be electronically steered and shaped in real-time without mechanically moving the
transducers. This enables targeting of different brain regions or adjusting the
stimulation pattern as needed during a session, making the procedure more versatile
and adaptable.

These features allow the stimulation to be tailored to suit to more specific
requirements. With ongoing research and development, they have the potential to
revolutionize the field of brain stimulation and offer new treatment options for
a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

This notebook will show how to define a phased array within NDK and experiment with
some of the available features. For more details, checkout the
[NDK documentation](https://agencyenterprise.github.io/neurotechdevkit/).

## Phased Arrays Components

* **Elements:** A phased array consists of multiple transducer elements that can be
individually controlled in terms of phase.
* **Pitch:** The pitch of a phased array refers to the distance between adjacent
transducer elements, and affects the resolution of the array.
* **Spacing:** The spacing between transducer elements affects the width and shape
of the ultrasound beam that is produced.
* **Aperture:** The aperture of a phased array refers to the total size of the array,
and affects the power and focus of the ultrasound beam.
* **Element width:** The element width of a phased array refers to the size of each
individual transducer element. Wider elements generally result in a more powerful
and focused beam, while narrower elements can increase the resolution of the array.
* **Tilt angle**: The tilt angle of a phased array refers to the angle at which the
ultrasound beam is directed relative to the normal of plane of the array. Tilt angle
can be adjusted by controlling the phase (delays) of the individual transducer elements.

Below we will go through some examples of how to use the NDK to API to simulate
Phased Arrays in the most common settings. Examples we will cover:

* Setting up a tilted wavefront
* Focusing phased arrays
* Setting up custom delays per element
* Phased arrays in 3D

## Phased Array NDK API

A PhasedArraySource receives the following parameters:

- position `(npt.NDArray[np.float_])`: a numpy float array indicating
    the coordinates (in meters) of the point at the center of the
    source, which is the point that bisects the line segment source.
- direction `(npt.NDArray[np.float_])`: a numpy float array representing
    a vector located at position that is perpendicular to the plane
    of the source. Only the orientation of `direction` affects the
    source, the length of the vector has no affect. See the
    `unit_direction` property.
- num_points `(int)`: the number of point sources to use when simulating
    the source.
- num_elements `(int)`: the number of elements of the phased array.
- pitch `(float)`: the distance (in meters) between the centers of neighboring
    elements in the phased array.
- element_width `(float)`: the width (in meters) of each individual element of
    the array.
- tilt_angle `(float)`: the desired tilt angle (in degrees) of the wavefront.
    The angle is measured between the direction the wavefront travels and the
    normal to the surface of the transducer, with positive angles resulting in a
    counter-clockwise tilt away from the normal.
- focal_length `(float)`: the distance (in meters) from `position` to the focal
    point.
- delay `(float, optional)`: the delay (in seconds) that the source will wait
    before emitting.
- element_delays: an 1D array with the delays (in seconds) for each element of the
    phased array. Delays from `element_delays` take precedence; No other
    argument affected the delays (`tilt_angle`, `focal_length` or `delay`)
    would be considered. ValueError will be raised if provided values for either
    `tilt_angle`, `focal_length` or `delay` are non-default.

# %%
# ## Tilting the Wavefront
# Tilting the wavefront can be achieved simply by setting the `tilt_angle`
# argument different than zero. Positive angles result in counter-clockwise rotations.

import numpy as np

import neurotechdevkit as ndk

# define the source
source = ndk.sources.PhasedArraySource2D(
    position=[0.0, 0.0],
    direction=[1.0, 0.0],
    num_elements=20,
    pitch=1.5e-3,
    element_width=1.2e-3,
    tilt_angle=30,
    num_points=1000,
)

scenario.compile_problem()
result = scenario.simulate_steady_state()

result.render_steady_state_amplitudes()

# %%
# ## Focusing
# Similarly, a phased array can be focused by applying delays in a specific way. Such
# delays are automatically computed when `focal_length` is defined. Let's explore how
# the API looks like:

scenario = ndk.scenarios.built_in.Scenario1_2D()

phased_array = ndk.sources.PhasedArraySource2D(
    position=[0.0, 0.0],
    direction=[1.0, 0.0],
    num_elements=20,
    pitch=1.5e-3,
    element_width=1.2e-3,
    focal_length=0.03,
    num_points=1000,
)

scenario.sources = [phased_array]
print(f"Focal point is: {phased_array.focal_point}")
# %%
# `focal_point` shows the coordinates (in meters) where the array focuses.
scenario.make_grid()
scenario.compile_problem()
result = scenario.simulate_steady_state()
assert isinstance(result, ndk.results.SteadyStateResult2D)
result.render_steady_state_amplitudes()
# %%
# We can see that the arrays focuses at a distance equal to `focal_length`.


# %%
# ## Custom Wavefront Shapes
# In the examples shown so far we specified high level arguments and the required
# delays were automatically computed. The NDK API offers also the possibility to
# specify delays directly to create arbitrary wavefront shapes.
#
# In the example below we apply monotonically increasing delays to mimic a
# counter-clockwise angle.

    element_delays=np.linspace(0, 1e-5, 20),
    num_points=1000,

scenario.sources = [phased_array]
scenario.make_grid()
scenario.compile_problem()
result = scenario.simulate_steady_state()
assert isinstance(result, ndk.results.SteadyStateResult2D)
result.render_steady_state_amplitudes()

# %%
# ## Phased Arrays In Three Dimensions
# There are two extra details to consider when creating 3D phased array sources:
# the `height` of the elements and the position of the `center_line`.
#
# - Height: Is the distance (in meters) of the element measured in a straight line
#   perpendicular to the `element_width` (see image below)
# - Center line: As the name indicates, is the line that crosses the centers of the
#   elements. Must be orthogonal to the direction line.
#
# ![phased-array-3d](../../images/phased-array-3d.png)
#
# The rest of the API is identical for both 2D and 3D scenarios.
