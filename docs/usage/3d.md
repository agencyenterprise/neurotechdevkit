### 3D Visualization

If you have `napari` installed you can also use the `napari` GUI for visualizing the scenario.

Install `napari` via pip:

```
pip install "napari[all]"
```

or by following the `napari` [installation instructions](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).

This integration is experimental, so you might unfortunately run into some issues, but experiments so far have been mostly successful.

```py
import neurotechdevkit as ndk

scenario = ndk.make('scenario-2-3d-v0')
scenario.render_layout_3d()
```

Napari allows you to view the scenario interactively from multiple directions, turn layers on or off, and change many different visualization parameters.

Below is a screenshot of what the viewer looks like when visualizing the scenario layout while showing the source and target.
